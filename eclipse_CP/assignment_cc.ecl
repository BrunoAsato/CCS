/*   
   Assignment problems in ECLiPSe.
   Different assignments problem, both minimization and maximization. 
   Model created by Hakan Kjellerstrand, hakank@bonetmail.com
   See also my ECLiPSe page: http://www.hakank.org/eclipse/
   Original from:
   http://www.hakank.org/eclipse/assignment.ecl

   This model was adapted by Claudio Cesar de Sa
   the kernel was changed aiming legibility for my students
   specifically, constraint C3
   
  Basically, my motivation was the exclusion of  "fromto" predicate in this kernel
  The fromto is powerfull predicate but with some dificulty to understand it.

  By the way:  all credits goes to Hakan

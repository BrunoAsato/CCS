Inside in interactive or console mode I missed of two details:

1. halt or ctl-z (d)  -- quit the system
please correct to:
   a) halt. 
   b) ctl-z  in Linux  system put the Picat in  sleeping process .... not in background this process, it is not applied quit neither.
   c) suggestion: ctl-c as an abort and exit of system integrality
                   or a warning about ctl-z that is used to exit partially of the system,
                   once that is in sleeping mode.

2. A miss a lot of a listing command to show all the predicates loaded by the interpreter.
   How to include a "listing" as in SWI-ProloG?
   USAGE:
   Picat> listing. (to show everything)
   Picat> listing(predicate  or function names). (to show parts of the code loaded)


cheers
